## Special Conditional
* 題目：

Given two boolean variables a and b, one of the following statements works differently than the others. Which one is it?
- [ ] not a == b
- [ ] not (a == b)
- [ ] a == (not b)
- [ ] a == not b

* 意思：哪一個選項跟其他三者的意思不同？
* 我的理解與學習筆記：答案是a == not b，因為會先執行"=="，然後才是"not"。

- [x] a == not b
